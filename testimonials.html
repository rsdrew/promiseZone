    {% include components/testimonial.html name="Sara Gajos" university="University of Michigan - Class of 2025" filename="sara-g" text="has been an absolute blessing regarding my college and professional careers. As a low-income, first generation college student, I was completely horrified when heading to the University of Michigan, so being able to have a group of people that had my best interest at heart was beneficial. I learned so much about getting involved in college, how to manage my time and workload, and efficiently build my network. The Hazel Park Promise Zone also aided me in obtaining an internship with Congresswoman Haley Stevens this past summer, and as a political science guru, I could not be more grateful. I have done very well in college so far and I owe a lot of that to the Hazel Park Promise Zone." %}
